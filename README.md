# SimplePackageManager
A very simple package manager entirely as a single SH script.

This is a work-in-progress simple package manager. Do not use it just yet as it is incomplete.

It is a shell script designed to work in the simplest shells (even uClinux msh), it supports having multiple sources for repositories and installing dependencies for packages recursively. 

To do:

- Uninstall
- Information
